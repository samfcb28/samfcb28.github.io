    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we examinad all 24 school districts in Maryland (23 counties and Baltimore City), and the money they spent on large transactions, deemed by our source as over $25,000. There are many variables in the total calculations of how much money a district can spend on their schools, but in the below graphs and tables we will show a comprehensive way analyse and look at the money spent at each school district and how it changes over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hope of this project is that the reader has a clear understanding of Maryland's educational spending, where the money goes, and how this varies between counties. School district funding has a large impact on a family or individual, so it is a crucial factor in where people chose where to live. A county that properly spends money on schooling shows that county's commitment and values in regards to public education. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine relations between Maryland counties in regards to spending and population, and will delve deeper into the data behind Baltimore County Public Schools budget. As former students of the district, we are familiar with the sucessus and failures of our county's education spending, and can use this to provide a unique outlook on the data set found here:\n",

    "# **Using the Data**\n",
    "We begin by using Python 3 and importing a few basic libraries such as pandas, numpy, math, and matplotlib.pyplot. \n",
    "\n",
    "As seen below in the table, tha data is sorted by school county in Maryland that had made the purchase, the year the purchase was made, to who the purchase went too and their zip code, and last the amount the purchase was made for. There are some school county's that had filled in the purpose of payment, but that was not consistent with every purchase and for that reason we will filter through the data to make it more readable and maipulate it so we get more specific data for certain county's and certain years.

We also went through the list of county names and removed any excessive spacing around the names of the counties so they all are consistently spaced and spelled. We reprint the entire data set so that readers can have an easier time going through the data again. "

By organizing by the amount money spent by every year, we can also track how much money Maryland gives to counties in total. By looking at the table we can see a clear increase of money spent ever year by all the counties. However, there are some major issues with this table. Because a lot of counties don't track the same spending as the others, we have a lot of spending missing data that causes the total spending to be very low. It causes there to be large jumps in the total spending amongst other years like between 2018 to 2019. "

Looking at this graph we can see Prince Georges County’s spending starts at a larger amount in 2010 and increases at a larger rate than the other two counties. Baltimore and Howard county’s spending stayed relatively the same through the years 2012 - 2020 which can really sway someone’s opinion on whether they would want to live in that school district, knowing that their spending will not increase by much in the next few years.

Despite the large amount of spending done in 2018, the growth of spending does not change much through 2012 to 2020. There was a considerable spike in transaction amount in 2018, but the other 7 years of spending stay consisitently around 3.75 hundred million."

    "In 2020, most counties in Maryland's largest single transaction was related to insurance or banking. As former Baltimore County students, seeing the data compute Hewlett Packard as the largest transaction is not surprising. We were familiar with the rapid shift to online learning under superintendent Dr Dallas Dance. This technological move while strong in principal left the students and teachers with small, underperforming, and expensive laptops and came under heavy critisicm from teachers, staff, and students. Dance was later convicted on criminal charges related to taking money from companies working with schools without reporting it. In 2020, while scaling back the initial plan, Baltimore County Public Schools is still working with the brand despite critism.\n",

    "# **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its size, Maryland is a very populous state, and there have been very great strides and public education equality in spending and funding. The reasons for differences in data and spending through the years can be very complex and have a multitude of variables that would be nearly impossible to account, but by using techniques learned in CMSC320 we are able to make sense of large data like this. We are able to understand, sort, analyse, and predict the data, which we would have not been able to do just 3 months ago. Looking at the charts, and tables we hope that a potential new resident of Maryland can make a educated decision of where they would like to live. This data can be also helpful for current residents who would like to possibly see change if they are not happy with their county's public funding.  "
